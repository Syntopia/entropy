Create a pedagogical tool for visualizing transition state theory. It should display a potential energy surface (3D plot) using three.js, with some sliders for creating gaussian potentials, and then calculate the transition state boundary between state A and state B. These states should be circular regions of the PES. It should use NEB to find the path between states and umbrella sampling along the path. Backend should be Python, but output should be HTML and three.js.
